## Acknowledging Agent Panel vs Admin Panel

In osTicket, there are two separate panels, the **admin panel** and **end user panel**.

The admin panel is used by system administrators and support staff to manage the entire ticketing system. Some of the responisbilities include **system settings**, **user and role management**, and **department management**.

The end user panel is used by support agents to manage and resolve tickets that are submitted by the end user. Some key features include **ticket management**, **ticket assignment**, **knowledgebase access**, and **communication with end users**.

The admin and agent panels also differs in user interfaces as well. The admin panel has more features and access to system and user configurations compared to the agent panel.
